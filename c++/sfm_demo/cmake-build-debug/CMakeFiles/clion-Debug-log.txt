CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/homebrew/share/pcl-1.14/Modules/FindFLANN.cmake:45 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable FLANN_ROOT is set to:

    /opt/homebrew

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "jsoncpp" with any
  of the following names:

    jsoncppConfig.cmake
    jsoncpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "jsoncpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "jsoncpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "jsoncpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
